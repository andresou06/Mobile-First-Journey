    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">Time on your Hands</strong> <br> <br> 
        This picture captures perfectly what I want to convey here: you must have some serious time on your hands to be reading this page. Or perhaps you're navigating the internet, learning and exploring freely. Time, combined with uninterrupted access to resources like a laptop, is a privilege that many people globally lack.
        
        On a world scale, having the luxury of time is extraordinary. It’s okay to feel puzzled about why you’ve been granted this privilege while others haven’t. But recognizing it is crucial. Why? Because if you’ve lived most of your life with this privilege—whether your means were humble or abundant—it can shape how you perceive the world.
        
        Here’s the thing: if you try to inspire or motivate someone to "do what you did" without acknowledging the privilege underpinning your success, you might face backlash. That backlash often takes the form of shame—not just for you, but for the person you’re trying to help. It’s a harsh reminder that privilege and access aren’t universal.</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">Good intentions put in the wrong places</strong> <br> <br>
                
        My ego once convinced me that I could help someone gain access to knowledge they desperately needed, but I failed to genuinely acknowledge their reality. This was someone without the luxury of free time, someone barely making a living. Instead of addressing the root of their struggles, I offered help that served more to soothe my own conscience than to provide meaningful support.
        
        In truth, this kind of help becomes a distraction—for both of you. It creates a fleeting sense of relief but doesn’t address the deeper inequities at play. And then shame steps in—a powerful current that pulls you away from your principles, your goals, and the vision you’ve set for yourself.
        
        If you’re lucky, you’ll find a moment of solitude to reflect and see where this misstep has led you. That moment of clarity is your chance to course-correct—before the weight of misplaced intentions erodes your ambitions entirely.</p>
