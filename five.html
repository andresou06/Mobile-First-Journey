    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">Test of endurance:</strong> <br> <br>Have you ever a felt something that pull you into a direction, like a current, bringing you back to where it all started when you are conversing with parents or people acting as reminder to question the usefullness of your endeavours in this world? <br> I'm sure for those that know that feeling, have come to repress their anger as if you started to feel again the unpleasant feeling of uselessness into what you envision and some people are just about here in this life to remind you of that feeling. Note it, analyse it... Don't you see ?</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">When IT endeavour weaken your heart:</strong> <br> <br>Some jobs weaken the heart more than others, I've seen seasoned workers behind the screens getting burned out over simple tweaks if you remove some of their confort or address them not like they feel entitled to. Those working in IT or as developer will never know the weight of carrying a persons life on their hands or applying a professional detachment from a patient who we know will not make it the next day. The worst that can happen in a field like IT at a Individual level is a server goes down. Yet It doesn't mean it has no meaning compare to a nurse, it can really help you on streamline a lof of life aspects but don't get it twisted either it's just an activity that ask you to be fluid so don't loose the human touch into your daily activity. Go out there and face some everyday troublesome jobs but essential. This might strenthen your heart and by the same token keep you grounded. Come on touch them does people won't bite you, remind these are people that still have a utter shy from everything to your Tech field. Remind yourself the story you tell yourself is the one that carries your life. </p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">At best I'll consider myself a Facilitator:</strong> <br> <br> Your knowledge might go deep on a technical and theorical level as a developer and you might be just about able to create, figuring out problems for others to be solved. It might make you a real smart, complex and forseeing problem solver but in the great skeem of things your a facilitator nonetheless for what you carry on you shoulder is nothing more than the weight of your prospects, ambitions, Good or bad deeds. Not the notoriety of a large Establishement, not the imideate life of others at your fingertips, not the pressure of risking your life to feed your family or worse to survive the next day. So take with Pride the fact to just be a Facilitator that will allow some aspects of life to be streamlined and enjoyed by others.</p>
