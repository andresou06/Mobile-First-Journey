    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">Test of endurance:</strong> <br> <br>Have you ever felt an invisible force pulling you back, like a current carrying you to where it all began? Conversations with parents or others who, knowingly or not, make you question the value of your efforts in this world can do that. For those who’ve felt it, the frustration is familiar—an uncomfortable reminder of feeling useless or misguided in your aspirations. And some people, intentionally or not, seem to exist solely to evoke that feeling.

        Instead of letting the anger simmer, take a step back. Note it. Analyze it. Don’t you see? That resistance isn’t just a challenge—it’s a chance to reaffirm your purpose.</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">When IT endeavour weaken your heart:</strong> <br> <br>Some professions weigh more heavily on the heart than others. I’ve seen seasoned IT workers crumble under the stress of seemingly minor issues, like a server glitch or losing the comfort of their established routines. The smallest disruptions can feel monumental in a world built around screens.

        But let’s put it into perspective. IT workers and developers will never know the emotional burden of holding someone’s life in their hands or the professional detachment required when a patient won’t make it through the night. The worst-case scenario for an individual in IT might be a server going down or a missed deadline—not life and death.
        
        That’s not to say IT lacks meaning. It’s a field that can revolutionize lives, streamline complexities, and enable incredible progress. But don’t let it consume you. Remember, it’s just an activity—a skill that demands adaptability. Don’t lose the human touch. Step outside your comfort zone and engage with essential, everyday work that keeps society running.
        
        Go out and meet people—those who might shy away from the complexities of tech, who still live in a world untouched by code. Remind yourself: The story you tell yourself is the one that shapes your life.

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">At best I'll consider myself a Facilitator:</strong> <br> <br> As a developer, your knowledge may run deep. You might solve complex problems, create innovative solutions, and push boundaries others can’t even see. This can make you feel brilliant, forward-thinking, and indispensable. But in the grand scheme of things, you’re a facilitator.

        The weight you carry is that of your ambitions, your goals, and the outcomes of your work. It’s not the immediate life-or-death decisions of a surgeon, the physical risk of laborers fighting to survive another day, or the immense pressure of keeping a family fed through dangerous circumstances.
        
        Take pride in being a facilitator. It’s a noble role—one that allows life’s finer details to function more smoothly, for people to connect, and for moments to be enjoyed. Recognize your contributions for what they are: important, meaningful, but ultimately part of a greater tapestry where everyone’s efforts, big and small, hold value.</p>
