    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We all have our bad moments:</strong> <br>Everyone has moments of gullibility or missteps in their youth. Most, however, don’t take those mistakes to the point of jeopardizing their future, social life, or closest relationships. Sensible people draw a line. That wasn’t the case for me. Overly sensitive and burdened by the pain of those around me, I lost sight of where I belonged. My actions sabotaged my own development, and by the time I turned 18, I had dropped out of high school—a significant failure at the time.

        To escape, I packed a small backpack and left to travel. For over five years, I lived in different countries, experiencing life as a drifter.</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Valuable intangible moments:</strong> <br>Among the highlights of my journey were the chefs I met in Ireland. Their passion for cooking struck a chord with me. Even now, I feel immense comfort in the rhythm of a kitchen—thanks to the camaraderie I found there. Cooks, in my eyes, are kindred spirits: non-academic, often living in their own worlds, deeply passionate, and prone to fiery tempers, yet endlessly fun.</p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Soft Imbalance</strong> <br>Leaving home taught me a lot. But back then, I was a mess—lost, distressed, and utterly selfish. I could handle the present and scrape by, but I couldn’t face who I was or why I acted as I did. Admitting that I was my own worst enemy was like looking into a mirror for the first time. In simple terms, I was heading nowhere—a failure in the making.

        In 2019, I landed a job at a local pub in Scotland. That experience hit me hard. It forced me to confront my immaturity. From there, I bounced between kitchen jobs, learning lessons along the way. Yet I lacked ambition or direction. I was an empty shell traveling the world, seeing breathtaking sights but living without purpose..</p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Still in muddy waters: </strong> <br>Accomplishments can be uplifting, but without perspective, you risk undoing all your efforts. I became a certified professional welder but soon hit a roadblock. In France, you can’t secure most welding jobs without a driver’s license. And getting one here? A labyrinth of bureaucracy and false promises that I naively fell for.

        So, I found myself back in the kitchen. But this time, I had a clearer purpose and a solid team to work with. Sometimes, that’s enough..</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Go for the change :</strong> <br>That season in the kitchen was the toughest yet most rewarding of my life. Alongside learning the craft, I carved out time to explore a new path: programming. I negotiated an extra day off each week to test the waters of a field that seemed distant but incredibly appealing. I wanted to see if I could develop a skill that might open new doors.</p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Be water, my friend: </strong> <br>After that season, I fell into a few more traps—intense part-time jobs, exploitative e-courses, and the harsh realities of the tech industry. But my determination kept me afloat. I stayed focused on learning, driven by my own ambitions and goals.

        Programming has become a cornerstone of my life. For me, it’s not just a skill; it’s a way to reject outdated models and embrace adaptability. It’s about reshaping my lifestyle with growth as the primary goal. With that mindset, I aim to make an impact—both in tech and beyond—and, ultimately, reclaim a sense of freedom.
