    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We all have our bad moments:</strong> <br>We've all been gullible, deceived at a young age once. We've all resorted in doing sketchy stuff as well but maybe not to the extend to put your future in jeopardy your social life and close relation at stack. Not any sensible person would do such thing...
        Well that's not my case, I was overly sensitive and holded the sheer pain of mentally suffering close ones, knew not where was my place, and self-jeopardize my development as I grow up and by the time I was 18, a high-school drop-out which was big deal at the time. I took off to travel, just me and a small backpack and lived in several countries for over 5 years. And GOD AM I NOT A BIG MOUTH.</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Valuable intangible moments:</strong> <br> Some good great chef figures met along the way in Ireland shared with me their passion for cooking wich resonated with me to some extend I feel to this day great confort in working in a kitchen for all the great people I had the chance to work with. I see cooks partly as people of my keen, non-academic, living in their own world, passionate, horrible temper but very fun.</p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Soft Imbalance</strong> <br>I've learned a great deal, once out there. I had no heart back then, felt misguided, lost, distress, for a long time, uterly selfish and could not deal with self-love, I could deal with the present and my very scarse situation but could not handle the mere thought of who I was, tracing a reason for my actions was but recognizing I was misleading myself all along by my perveted mind who was set to jeopardize me. Look to put it simply: I was not cut ! Plain and simple, a failure in the making. <br> I went to work through a pub local beer venue in Scotland in 2019 and I learn how bad of a little shit I was. Learned it the hard way and from there a successions of back and forth journeys in different kitchens. But I never took it seriously back then. I felt not a glimpse of ambition nor aspiration in my life. A empty shell that would carry on to travel the world seeing beautiful scenery with no purpose.</p>    
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Small idea, big difference: </strong> <br>One day, around the age of 22, I got a sense that my life should more adventurous and meaningful. And a simple video of a diving welder underwater change maybe the course of my life, put me "back on rails". Made me come back to my country with a purpose that was to erase everything I was or failed to become, to turn into a guy grounded in achieveing something simple but meaningfull. But my mind had still to undergo mature states before I could look myself in a miror.</p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Still in muddy waters: </strong> <br>Sometimes after achieving something meaningful you feel lifted-up but if you're not staying grounded and seing the big picture you can fool yourself and waste all the efforts you've put: I got my certificate of a pro Welder but could not get a job  without a driving licence you'll not get a work because there won't be any work to get to. Simple as that, and get a Driving Licence in France is a Hoax of the first order where they drawn you in false marketing claim for wich I've falled for. <br> So here I am after some time back in a Kitchen, but this time with a weird purpose of mine in mind and a fine team to work with that's as good as it gets.</p>
    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Go for the change :</strong> <br>I go throught the smoothest yet hardest yet best kitchen season of my life learn plenty and dedicate a fair amount of time to acquint myself to a new concept called Programming and try to invistigate that world that looks so so sooo far yet so appealing and could only do that because I set my contract in a way to get one more day off so I could try to see for myself  If setting myself for another kind of life was actually feasible. With the eager to unlock a secret skill that would advantage me in life. </p>

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Be water, my friend: </strong> <br>I got into a few more traps after that season: Got into another high intense job part time while dedicating full-time in learning from E-course that got me to see the ugly exploitative nature of the tech landscape as well. But I did/could brush it off because of my eager to make advancement into the tech field, following my own approach drived by my own ambitions and goals and passion. Programming is playing a taking a big part in my life now, but is meaning for me is to get you to renonce traditional models and make you as fluid as possible, reshaping your lifestyle where growth is the only thing to aim at. Then your impact may range from everything tech to non-tech related. </p>
