            <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">Basic Programming skills as Survivalism in the Digital-First World:</strong> <br><br>
                In an era relying mainly on Technologies, Programming skills have not become optional but <strong>essential as tools to navigate and be in control of our lives, I call it survivalism:</strong>
                <br><br>
                    <strong>Let's get this out of the way first:</strong><br>
    Basic Programming skills can be picked up by <strong>anybody</strong> where lies a will and a clear understanding (acceptance more importantly) that there won't <strong>ever</strong> be a journey's end to learn programming for it is inherently an Incremental Discovery.<br><br>
                <strong>Now a few key points:</strong><br><br>
            - You <strong>don't </strong>need to be /or have a drive to become a Professional Developer <br>
            - You <strong>don't</strong> need to buy (even though we all go through that unglorious phase at first) the "Most up-to-date" Course/ Bootcamp out there.<br><br>
            - You need to simply realize that the best things are Free(Official Documentation/ free-tutorial/ Your own Project) <br>
            - You simply need <strong>enough</strong> to navigate and assert control over the Technologies shaping your life. And Incrementaly decide what you'll make of it.

    <p class="p_story"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;"> The Mindset of Digital Self-Reliance: </strong><br><br>
        <Strong class="font-size: 1.5rem">Basic Programming is Empowerment not ambition</Strong>,
    It allows you to automate task to reclaim your mental energy, to create your own content without the need for third party tools or agents, to solve problems when technologies alone fails to provide solutions to your personal needs or even present unnecessary barriers. <br><br>
    In a realm designed and shaped by other people before you, you'll step into that world claiming: <br>
    <em>"I understand this, I can change this, I control this"</em>
