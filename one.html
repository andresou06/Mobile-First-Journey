            <p class="p_story marcellus-regular"><strong style="font-size: 2rem;">Basic Programming skills as Survivalism in the Digital-First World:</strong> <br><br>
                In an era relying mainly on Technologies, Programming skills have not become optional but <strong>essential as tools to navigate and be in control of our lives, I call it survivalism, you call it whatever you want</strong>
                <br><br>
                    <strong>Let's get this out of the way first:</strong><br>
    Basic Programming skills can be picked up by <strong>anybody</strong> where lies a will and a clear understanding (acceptance more importantly) that there won't <strong>ever</strong> be a journey's end to learn programming for it is inherently an Incremental Discovery.<br><br>
                <strong>Now a few key points:</strong><br><br>
            - You <strong>don't </strong>need to be /or have a drive to become a Professional Developer<br>
            - You <strong>don't</strong> need to buy (even though we all go through that unglorious phase at first) the "Most up-to-date" Course/ Bootcamp out there.<br><br>
            - You need to simply realize that the best things are Free(Official Documentation/ free-tutorial/ Your own Project) <br>
            - You simply need <strong>enough</strong> to navigate and assert control over the Technologies shaping your life. And then, figure out what you'll make of it..

        <Strong class="font-size: 1.5rem">Basic Programming is Empowerment not ambition</Strong>,
        Basic programming is not about ambition—it’s about empowerment. It’s a tool that enhances any role or position you find yourself in. Regardless of the industry, programming lets you streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks to reclaim mental energy, and create your own content without relying on third-party tools or agents. It equips you to solve problems when technology alone fails to meet your unique needs or presents unnecessary barriers.

In a world designed and shaped by others before you, programming lets you step forward with confidence, declaring:
"No matter where I stand, I will always have the ability to contribute meaningfully, stay in control, and improve both my life and the lives of those around me."
